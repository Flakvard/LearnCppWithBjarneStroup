/*
Drill
This drill simply involves getting the sequence of versions of Date to work.
For each version define a Date called today initialized to June 25, 1978. 
Then, define a Date called tomorrow and give it a value by copying today into it and increasing 
its day by one using add_day(). Finally, output today and tomorrow using a << defined as in §9.8.
Your check for a valid date may be very simple. Feel free to ignore leap years. 
However, don’t accept a month that is not in the [1,12] range or day of the month 
that is not in the [1,31] range. Test each version with at least one invalid date (e.g., 
2004, 13, –5).
 3. The version from §9.4.3
 4. The version from §9.7.1
 5. The version from §9.7.4

    1. List sets of plausible operations for the examples of real-world objects in 
    §9.1 (such as toaster). 
    startToaster();
    stopToaster();
    checkCelsius();
    checkButton();
    setMeasurementCelsius();
    setTimer();
    startTimer();
    checkTimer();

/*
    2. Design and implement a Name_pairs class holding (name,age) pairs where 
    name is a string and age is a double. Represent that as a vector<string>
    (called name) and a vector<double> (called age) member. Provide an input operation read_names() that reads a series of names. Provide a read_
    ages() operation that prompts the user for an age for each name. Provide 
    a print() operation that prints out the (name[i],age[i]) pairs (one per line) 
    in the order determined by the name vector. Provide a sort() operation 
    that sorts the name vector in alphabetical order and reorganizes the age
    vector to match. Implement all “operations” as member functions. Test 
    the class (of course: test early and often).

# LearnCppWithBjarneStroup
From the book Programming Principles and Practice using C++ 

I have chosen VIM as my primary IDE for this and the [my customization are here](https://github.com/Flakvard/.vimrc/blob/main/.vimrc.vim), if interested. I use the G++ compiler.
- [x] Chapter 1 this chapter focused only on introduction to software and programming in general. A good and inspiring read. 
- [x] [Chapter 2](https://github.com/Flakvard/LearnCppWithBjarneStroup/tree/main/Chapter_2) there werent that many exercies or drills, but a ton of new words and details behind the programming language and how everything fits together. Good stuff.
- [x] [Chapter 3](https://github.com/Flakvard/LearnCppWithBjarneStroup/tree/main/Chapter_3) the exercises and drills were okey. I think some of them were very fast to complete, but it was only because of the help of past experience with other programming languages. Alot of different statements like ifs and switchs and loops like while and for. The thing that was most challanging was all the new words to remember and to understand. 
- [x] [Chapter 4](https://github.com/Flakvard/LearnCppWithBjarneStroup/tree/main/Chapter_4) the exercises and drills were all about vectors/arrays in c++ and using for- and while-loops to compute arguments into results. It was challenging and fulfilling to complete all 21 of them. 
- [x] [Chapter 5](https://github.com/Flakvard/LearnCppWithBjarneStroup/tree/main/Chapter_5) the exercises had error handling and catch errors. A game of Bulls and Cow was also quite challanging to write. I think reading the chapter was more interesting than the exercises this time.
- [x] [Chapter 6](https://github.com/Flakvard/LearnCppWithBjarneStroup/tree/main/Chapter_6) I had a long pause from working with C++. Especially from universtity and starting a family. 150 LeetCode problems got me going again. These exercies in chapter 6 were good, but not so fun and was also a reason I paused. 
- [ ] [Chapter 7](https://github.com/Flakvard/LearnCppWithBjarneStroup/tree/main/Chapter_7) Did not like all the exercises, but it was nice to finally feel like I understand what is going on in a 'bigger' program and make modifications to better the program. I can actually see how I can better this program and make it more user friendly. I think I might turn it into a simple unix program/command for my linux computers. 
- [ ] [Chapter 8](https://github.com/Flakvard/LearnCppWithBjarneStroup/tree/main/Chapter_8) I had fun doing this one. It made be spend some time working on makefiles and unit testing with gtest, which was very helpful. The chapter had nothing to do with testing and makefiles specifically, but thats what I ended up in. Also working with structs and functions was also good'
